I know a sickness <br>
So ancient and cross <br>
No crucifix
Could ever fix enough
In the basement of a church
These people, they talk
There is a line
That must be walked
If you wanna make it stop
Then stop

I know a place
Where the future is denied
I know a hand
That twitches inside
For some of us the glass
Is filled with lights
But if the honey
Makes you sick
Honey, there is a line
That must be walked
If you wanna make it stop
Then stop
Stop

Lie down
You don't have to talk
Slow down
Breathe
Stop
Slow down
It's not your fault
Look around
There's so many of us
So many of us
You are not alone
Ever
Ever
Ever
Stop

Call in the backup and the backup comes
Nobody can help you if you won't
Inside your chest your heart is just hurt
Behind your eyes a need replaced a want

I know a sickness so ancient and cross
A crucifix can never fix enough
I know a past when the future is lost
I know of a line that must be walked

There is a darkness and there is a light
And there is a choice.
For a balance to be made every night
A weakness must be found
If you want it to stop
Stop
Stop

面对着现在 我已经开始有了感慨 
有时也会想到了未来 却依然发呆 
谁的爱情太慷慨 
谁的理想走的那么快 
谁的模样他从耍帅到耍赖
都是自己活该 
曾经 以为 时间是条不停的河流 
没想过有个大海就在我背后 
曾经 以为 爱是一个不眠的白昼 
可它总有一个黑夜来把你带走 

人生太难猜 多数时候好景不常在
童话里面人人若相爱 白头就不离开 
谁陪着我生活 又是谁们教会我去爱 
我终于明白我不是天才 也不是 尘埃

You ready?
Lets go
Yeah
For those who wanna know what we're all about
Its like this y'all
It's 10% luck
20% skill
15% conncentrated power of will
5% pleasure
50% pain
and 100%reason to remember the name
Mike!
he doesnt need his name up in lights
he just wants to be heard whether its the beat or the mic
he feels so unlike every body else, alone
in spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
but Fuck em
he knows the code:
its not about the salary, its all about reality
and making some noise
making the story
making sure his clique stays up
that means when he puts it down, tak's pickin it up
Who the hell is he anyway?
he never really talks much
never concerned with status
but still leavin 'em starstruck
humbled through oppurtunities
givin despite the fact
that many misjudge him
because he makes a living from writing raps
put it together himself
and the picture connects
never askin for someones help, or to get some respect
hes only focused on what he wrote
his will is beyond reach
and now it all unfolds
the skill of an artiste
80% beer
Be 100% clear
cuz ryu is ill
who woulda thought hed be the one to set the west in flames
I heard him wreck it with the crystal method Name of the game
Came back dropped megadef, took em to church
i like bleach man
ryu had the stupidest verse
this dude is the truth
now everybodys givin him guest spots
his stocks through the roof
i heard hes fuckin with s-dot!
ryu!
They call him ryu the sick
and hes spitting fire and mic
got him out the dryer hes hot
found him in fort Minor With Tak
He's a fucking nihilist porcupine
hes a prick hes a cock
the type women wanna be with and rappers hope he gets shot
8 years and the makin
patiently waitin to blow
now the record with shinoda's
takin over the globe
hes got a partner in crime
his shit is equally dope
you wont believe the kinda shit that comes outa of this kids throat
tak!
He's not your every day on the block
he knows how to work with what hes got makin his way to the top
he often gets a comment on his name
people keep askin him was it
given at birth
or was it stand for an acronym
No
He's livin proof, look at him rockin the booth
he'll get you buzzin quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
dedicated to what they do, and give 100
forget mike
nobody real knows how or why, he works so hard it seems like hes never got time
becuz he writes every note, and he writes every line
and ive seen him at work, when that light goes on in his mind
its like a design is written in his head every time
before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
and those mothafuckas he runs with, the kids that he signed, rediculous
without even tryin
how do they do it?
Fort Minor
M Shinoda
Styles of Beyond
Ryu, Takbir, Cheapshot!
